            <description>Introduction Hello there, I do not know how you manage to come here but I welcome you nevertheless. For those of you who may not know me, I am but a simple cyber security researcher. This blog would serve as a way to document down technical details of vulnerabilities / useful workflows I found while progressing through my career.
Goals The aim of this blog is to teach other researchers tricks and tips that they may not have known.</description>

<p>Hello there, I do not know how you manage to come here but I welcome you nevertheless. For those of you who may not know me, I am but a simple cyber security researcher. This blog would serve as a way to document down technical details of vulnerabilities / useful workflows I found while progressing through my career.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>The aim of this blog is to teach other researchers tricks and tips that they may not have known. In addition, if the opportunity arises, I will also share in-depth analysis on CVEs I find interesting.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>This blog will most likely be continuously updated as the years go by as it is free. Thanks Hugo!</p>
